        <h3>Well first of all what do we know about sensors:</h3>
        <p>
            A sensor is a device which detects or measures a physical
            property and records, indicates, or otherwise responds to it.
        </p>
        <h3>What devices already use sensor:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Smoke detector</li>
            <li>Leak/moisture detection</li>
            <li>Window and door open and close sensor</li>
            <li>Video doorbell</li>
            <li>Smart thermostat</li>
            <li>Smart garage door</li>

        <h3>How we came up with the idea?</h3>
        <p>
            Some kids are scared of the dark and need the use of a
            night light to sleep peacefully. The stem lingo kit gives
            us access to the ability to cut lights on and off with a sensor.
            So we will set the stem lingo kit up in a way to sense our hand
            infront of it like a paper towel dispenser. 
            Meaning when a child is about to go to sleep they will just be
            able to wave their hand infront of the sensor to activate it.
            The Sensor Night Light will stay on the entire time while a child
            is asleep. You can also change the color of your night light. 
            The colors you can pick from are red, yellow, green, and blue.
        <p>
        <h3>The problem were trying to solve.</h3>
        <p>
            Were trying to help kids ease into conquering their
            fear of the dark. It’s as simple that. :)

            afraid of the dark, but of course they don’t have jobs or
            money so their parents will be the ones who purchase our
